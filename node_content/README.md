# maxPosenet

This example wraps the ml5 example by Daniel Shiffman and Gene Kogan via Node-JS socket into MaxMSP.

# note:

After opening maxpatch you'll need to open a new browserwindow with address "localhost:3000".
I'm doing this via sh script and a chromium app in the same folder.



# note 2.

In this particular patch I'm only using nose and ellbow data.
But if you know a tiny winy bit of Javascript you can change the dataset in sketch.js.
